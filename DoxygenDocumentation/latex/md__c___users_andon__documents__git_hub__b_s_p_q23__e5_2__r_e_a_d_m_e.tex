Manage your hotels or reservations in an easy way.

\doxysection*{Building the project}

The client can be compiled into a jar to later run it via Java while the server it\textquotesingle{}s directly ran by maven.

To pack the client you can either run the {\ttfamily build\+Client.\+bat} located in the root folder or type the following command in the Client folder\+:

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}mvn install -\/Dskip\+Tests

To run the project you can run the following command

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}java -\/jar \mbox{[}Client\mbox{]}$\ast$/target/\+Client-\/0.0.\+1-\/SNAPSHOT-\/jar-\/with-\/dependencies

To run the server, you can either run the {\ttfamily run\+Server.\+bat} or run the following command in the Server folder\+:

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}mvn compile datanucleus\+:enhance exec\+:java -\/Dskip\+Tests

To run the JUnits found in each module of the project you can just run

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}mvn test

and you\textquotesingle{}ll find the corresponding result in {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Client/\+Server\mbox{]}$\ast$/target/jacoco.exec}

Or enter the target folder and double clicking the jar file (In the case of the Server it\textquotesingle{}s not recommended as it does not have a GUI, if you want to kill the process afterwards you will have to kill the entire java proccess)

\doxysubsection*{Datanucleus}

To be able to use the database you will need the next command, included already in the building / running commands from above\+:

\begin{quote}
mvn datanucleus\+:enhance \end{quote}
If a change affects the deletion or adition of a column, you may need to run the next command in order for the database to work properly

\begin{quote}
mvn datanucleus\+:enhance datanucleus\+:schema-\/delete \end{quote}
To create the database, make use of the following SQL code, this project runs on My\+SQL\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{DROP}\ SCHEMA\ \textcolor{keywordflow}{IF}\ \textcolor{keyword}{EXISTS}\ HotelManager;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{DROP}\ \textcolor{keyword}{USER}\ \textcolor{keywordflow}{IF}\ \textcolor{keyword}{EXISTS}\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{'spq'}@\textcolor{stringliteral}{'localhost'};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{CREATE}\ SCHEMA\ \textcolor{keywordflow}{IF}\ \textcolor{keyword}{NOT}\ \textcolor{keyword}{EXISTS}\ HotelManager;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{CREATE}\ \textcolor{keyword}{USER}\ \textcolor{keywordflow}{IF}\ \textcolor{keyword}{NOT}\ \textcolor{keyword}{EXISTS}\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{'spq'}@\textcolor{stringliteral}{'localhost'}\ IDENTIFIED\ \textcolor{keyword}{BY}\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{'spq'};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{GRANT}\ \textcolor{keyword}{ALL}\ \textcolor{keyword}{ON}\ HotelManager.*\ \textcolor{keyword}{TO}\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{'spq'}@\textcolor{stringliteral}{'localhost'};}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you like to check if all tables will generate correctly you can use

\begin{quote}
mvn datanucleus\+:enhance datanucleus\+:schema-\/create \end{quote}
